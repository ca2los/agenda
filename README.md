*v.1.0*

The project is a quick view of how online services like 'Monday', work through 
browsers with editable text contents, and saving information after editing an
element. To make it possible, the project makes use of JS principles, jQuery basics, 
and libraries like Moment JS.

    * Edit a block in the agenda and add text inside of it
    * Save data after clicking the disk button
    * Saved data is stored inside the local storage
    * Delete a block if it's not necessary
    * The size and color of blocks change as time goes
